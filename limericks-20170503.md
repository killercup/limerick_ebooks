Rust-land is a very strange place
sans null deref nor data race
it has its own styles
but once it compiles
it will not blow up in your face

---

In Rust-land, much unlike in C
[`borrowck`] looks out for me.
It checks all my borrows
'gainst aliasing sorrows
and lets me code concurrently.

[`borrowck`]: # "The Rust borrow checker will prove that no mutable reference coexists with another reference, thus ensuring memory safety"

---

Rustaceans are very polite
read the [Code of Conduct] each night
We value the lot
including [each bot]
and don't shout ['WHO SENT ME THIS SHITE?']

[Code of Conduct]: https://rust-lang.org/conduct "The Rust Community follows the Code of Conduct, which essentially boils down to basic decency"
[each bot]: # "The Rust community is known to rely on and befriend bots"
['WHO SENT ME THIS SHITE?']: http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1702.2/05171.html "Linus Torvalds, Kernel head honcho, lashes out against one of his lieutenants"

---

For fast stuff, please code in in Rust
Or do it in C if you must,
But do it correct
Or your data is wrecked.
Egad! get it working or bust.

---

In Rust-land we're for code reuse
We take a stand against abuse
We're having good fun
While getting stuff done
Come join us now if you so choose

---

Sometimes your Rust code looks weird
Because many sigils appeared
Yet the reason behind
is not hard to find
So really it is to be cheered

---

As gladly for Rust I will reach
it's a language I don't want to teach
far too complex‚Äìno joke
and it doesn't evoke
mental images of walks on the beach

---

With Rust you're getting Results
unlike any lang-based cults
Where the right way to code
lets yer neurons erode
adding to injury the insults

---

Need to save memory and don't know how?
You want to consider a Cow
so instead of a clone
you can borrow or own
So use it all in your code now!

---

I'm coding in Java by day
sometimes it gets in my way

---

Some new rustic RFCs landed
The process is quite heavy-handed

Let `x` be a mutable slice üçâ

Let a üíØ Rust crates bloom

and useful-code-wealthy
despite trolls spelling impending doom

Who knows what Rust [in six weeks]
give us new features and tweaks
will it blend? will it slice?
and be awesome and nice?
Now I sound like a total geek.

Your data will silently plop

[`Result`] is a return type tailored
to functions that either do fail or

to the calling process
viz. Rust is quite candid on failure

[`Result`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html

---

Rustaceans will usually track
their heap usage forwards and back
so no allocation
lead to altercation
One could say that we code full-stack

---

```rust
for i in [1, 2].iter().map(
|x| x + 1).filter(|zap|
zap % 2 == 0) {
    println!("You are my hero");
} // ok, now I'm taking a nap

When [C++ devs discussed Rust]
some of them concluded we must
reign in some people
who shout "wake up, sheeple"
(and I think their request is just)

Some people will evermore be
fascinated by [K&R]'s C
though it will crash and burn
they do hope once to learn
to work with [`malloc` and `free`]

[K&R]: # "Brian Kernighan & Dennis Ritchie, creators of the C programming language"
[`malloc` and `free`]: # "C functions for error-prone manual memory management"

---

If in Rust code you need to store
one item of some type or more,
you say: "What the heck!
Let's simply use [`Vec`]!"
(the name is omitting a "tor")

[`Vec`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html

With Google now running the show
The zeitgeisty language is Go

[Thompson & Pike]: # "Two of Go's creators"

Rust does have some likeable [traits]
works well with [mutable states]
we can safely abstract
what in C can be cracked
so the risk of pwnage abates

[traits]: # "Traits in Rust allow to describe behavior while abstracting the data"
[mutable states]: # "Because Rust disallows mutation only in concurrent settings, it works very well with it, unlike some functional languages"

---

Any closure will ‚Äì if it can
implement a trait we call [`Fn`]
also be [`FnMut`]
(and that's double plus good)
and perhaps [`FnOnce`] once again

[`Fn`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Fn.html
[`FnMut`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.FnMut.html
[`FnOnce`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.FnOnce.html

---

Rust's [`Default`] trait gets more hype
the more you use it for a type
for you may wanna strive
to use auto-`#[derive]`
Result: You have less code to type

[`Default`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/default/trait.Default.html "A trait to abstract the notion of a default value. Can be auto-derived for structs/enums if all components in turn implement it"

---

Rust's `match` clause has sufficient might
to destructure values alright
Its arms may be guarded
its patterns regarded
conceptually really tight

---

"Rust will fail 'cause of its style,
borrowck and time to compile,
all that complexity
is not even in C!"
(now that's what trolls mostly revile)

You want Rust to parse ‚Äì you may choose
[nom], [combine], [chomp], [LALRPOP], [peruse],
[pom], [peel] or another
there are many other
Now you still don't know which one to use

[nom]: https://crates.io/crates/nom
[combine]: https://crates.io/crates/combine
[chomp]: https://crates.io/crates/chomp
[LALRPOP]: https://crates.io/crates/lalrpop

```rust

println!("{} √ó BADA-BUM",
0u64 + sum);

---

If you implement [`From<T>`] for `U`
Rust will freely deliver [`Into`]
so use `From` if it fits
(if th'orphan rule permits)
and the rest the compiler will do

[`From<T>`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.From.html
[`Into`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.Into.html

---

When in Rust code you use a `for`
it'll loop and each time ask for more
if it does get a [`None`]
iteration is done
otherwise there's [`Some(value)`] in store
