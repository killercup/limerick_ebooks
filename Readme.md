# Limerick book

As poets and coders already know  
To tell is just as fun as to show  
So let's print a book  
That gives us a look  
At how an awesome community does grow  

## Make it do things

0. Have Rust and Cargo installed.
1. Clone this repo
2. Run `cargo run` and get an HTML file in `dist/` that you can look at and print.

Bonus: `cargo run -- --help` will show all possible option you can pass to the binary.
